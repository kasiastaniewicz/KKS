The file named assignment4.py contains the code which we put on BlueCrystal. It is the same as the one in the Jupyter Notebook, only 
in a different format.
The file named results_from_bc4.log contains the results we obtained from BlueCrystal. It contained a lot of lines where the accuracies of 
each epoch were calculated. We have removed those because they made the file too big and weren't that important. They also made the relevant
parts hard to find. 
The file Neural Networks - tensorflow is the main Jupyter Notebook which contains our code.
